### Course Description
This graduate seminar focuses on agents, subjects and objects that catalyzed the material and political orders from 1500-1800 in South Asia. We read recent monographs which demonstrate the intersections between narrative and polity within material and epistemic realms. Our guiding interests will be in understanding the intimate relationship between power, agency and materiality within specific political spaces. Eschewing the center/periphery models, we will focus on specific sites of literary and political imagination and then turn to primary, historical texts (in translation) from  this period.

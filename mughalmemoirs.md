### Course Description

The early sixteenth century rise of the Mughal authority in North India coincided with the arrival of the Portuguese in South India, the emergence of Safavid empire, and the dominance of the Ottoman empire. Within the first hundred years, even more claimants to imperial power in India – the British, the French, the Rajput, the Maratha – were engaged in political negotiations, resistance and accommodation with the Mughal. We will follow the course of the development of Mughal political thought, economic and environmental impact and courtly culture through to their official demise in 1857.

The first four emperors of Mughal India left various accounts for us. Babur (r. 1525–1530), the founder of the dynasty, wrote an autobiography. Memoirs of the second, Humayun (r. 1530–1556), were written by his sister, and others in his army. The third, Akbar (r. 1556–1605) was the subject of the most comprehensive regnal history-- written by his minister and aide Abu'l Fazl. His son Jahangir (r. 1605–1627), recorded his daily activities and thoughts in his own journal that was published by him. The fourth Shahjahan and his son, Dara Shikoh also contributed to narrating their selves.

To best engage with this complex universe, we will use the semantic vocabulary of ‘seeing’. This course will delve into how Mughal emperors saw their world and how they narrated it. This course is almost exclusively focused on primary readings. We will read large portions of the texts written by the Mughal elite. We will read them to examine their treatment of sacral landscape, nature and environment, gender, social networks, power and violence, agency and interiority, performativity, usage of history and memory. 

This focus on memoir and autobiographical writing would allow us to delve far deeply into the socio-cultural worlds of the Mughal then is possible via a perfunctory reading of secondary sources.

### Course Policies:

**Land Acknowledgment:** At Columbia's Morningside campus, we acknowledge that we are on the territory of the Lenape and Wappinger peoples. Many indigenous communities have lived in and moved through this place over time. Indigenous people from many nations live and work in this region today.  We acknowledge their communities by paying respect to their elders past and present, and recognizing their active presence and their futurity, reposed in the generations present and those to come.

**Classroom Etiquette** are best practices of your academic and social lives: be considerate in class; arrive before official class time; listen well; interact with your colleagues with respect and compassion; turn off your phone; and turn off your computing devices. One basic goal of this class is to learn through careful reading and discussion of primary texts, you are required to bring copies of all assigned works to class to facilitate discussion during class session. You will be expected to constantly “read around” the material, looking up key terms and people in encyclopedias, dictionaries, articles, and other references - to situate your own knowledge within the class.

**Academic integrity** is a basic understanding of our engagement in this course. I make a commitment to engage ethically and honestly with you, and I expect the same commitment. Plagiarism or dishonesty and unethical behavior is unacceptable and you will face punitive measures. You should be well-aware and actively cognizant of Columbia University's commitment to Academic Integrity. You can read the policy here. In this class, you are required to submit your original work, properly cited, for each assignment. The usage of BARD, chatGPT or any other AI front-end to a LLM in order to generate ideas, begin or end writing assignments, clean up grammar or fill out paragraphs is prohibited.  If you need help with writing, you should visit the writing center or my office hours. Please turn your mobile phones off when you sit down in the class. If you have any concerns, problems, issues, please talk to me. I can help. 

**Attendance** is required, necessary and crucial for successful completion of the course. Unexcused absences beyond one will result in grade devaluation, as will consistent late arrivals or disruptions. 

**Accommodations** are happily available. I endeavor to provide an inclusive learning environment. If you experience any barriers to learning in this course, do not hesitate to discuss them with me.

**Participation** is defined as consistent and constant presence in the course and engagement with the materials and your colleagues. This means perfect attendance, excellent listening and communication skills in class; the capacity to focus and encourage dialogue with your peers; respectful and thoughtful interactions. I will assign "out of class" events which you must attend to get credit towards your participation grade. This includes visits to the galleries, museums and/or talks in NYC.

#### Online Responses/Blogs: DUE Before EACH CLASS. 

You are to post to Discussions section on Courseworks, your analytical response to the readings for that session. The response should hover around 300 words. A response should three sections to 1) a brief overview of what happened in the text 2) use a key concepts and do an analysis of what you have read 3) 2-3 questions/wonder out aloud/that you have about the text. The summary of the reading is a thumbnail sketch. The concepts are: Gender, Body, Sexuality, Warfare, Enslavement or Bonded Labor, Material Culture, Nature. The questions are things you are unclear, want to explore in class, have your peers respond. I encourage people to read each other's responses. There are 10 responses. 

**NB:** For the first response, you have a prompt. "What did you know about the Mughal Empire before this class, and what do you expect to learn about it in this class."

#### Baburnama Exercise: 
We want to think about how Babur imagines space & time in his memoir. You will do this by making a "Presence List" of Babur. Begin with starting a spreadsheet with five columns. As you read, track the physical space (name of town/place) that Babur is physically in, and note the action that happens there. Note also the folio number and the instance of the place (is it the first, second, or third place mentioned in the folio). 

Sample entry from the first fifty pages beginning:

folio; instance; name; type; action

16, 1, Andizhan, citadel, going to meet
31b, 2, Shahrukhiya, city, visit uncle 
32, 1, Shahrukhiya, garden outside, meet uncle. 
33b, 2, Ura-Tayube, area, with his troops,
33b, 3, Andizhan, citadel, retreat. 

You are also welcome to make a "Sentiment" list instead of the Presence list. Same structure but this time, track places where Babur gives a sense of his emotions (he is happy, afraid, sad, angry). 


#### Visual Culture Essay: 
The essay will focus on a particular Mughal art work or building or coin or any object and can examine historic categories (say, the depiction of interior or street spaces) or aesthetic ones (say, particular motifs from Sufism or colors or moods). Utilizing the memoirs, I am asking you to particularly link varied representations into one argument, to showcase development, change or stress uniqueness. The essay should incorporate research into the manuscript culture as well as contemporary significance. You can use the online archives of British Library, MET, Google Cultural Institute, and the various museums with collections on Flickr. You can utilize any of the manifold catalogues in Avery (citational rules apply). You can also look at YouTube for tourist videos from contemporary visitors. Your slide count should be around 25-30. 

#### MOVIE RESPONSE:
Watch Jodhaa Akbar (2008) or Mughal-e Azam (1960)---both available with subtitles on streaming/youtube and on reserve media in Butler. Write a 500 word response, that highlights the convergences and differences in what you learned in the film versus what you learned in the class from reading the primary sources. 

#### Gallery Visit: 
You are to visit any of the following area museums-- The MET, Asia Society, and Rubin Museum of Art-- and visit their Mughal artifacts/object. You are to write a 1-2 page response on why the object/painting caught your attention and include a selfie of yourself with your favorite piece from the Mughal history in the Museum.

This course examines the processes of colonization and decolonization that define the making of a modern, integrated world (c. 1500 to the present). We will study primary source materials.  We focus on the instruments of colonization—the treaty, the charter, the map, the ethnology—and the engines of decolonization—the manifesto, the resistance, the solidarity with the colonial, the demand for self rule. We are interested in the processes and contents of social and cultural contact and exchange, the development of knowledge, and how they shape relations of power; the place of colonialism in the development of western capitalism; and the elements of colonial power and resistance, including ideologies of liberal political philosophy, social Darwinism, and nationalism.  We will consider how ideas about race, civilization, religion, self and other, and freedom have evolved over time and shaped the making of the modern world.

In 2023-24 AY, CSER (the host unit for this course) is undergoing a push towards departmentalization. With that focus, this particular flavor of Col/Decol will focus on the site of the University, on Disciplines and on Departments and how they are implicated in (and form) colonial epistemic violence.  At Columbia University, there are several critical venues for you to familiarize yourself BEFORE the semester: Columbia University & Slavery,  Columbia 1968, (and here),  Real-Estate holdings,  Historical Justice Initiative.

Class is held as a discussion seminar and I expect every one to have *read* and *digested* the readings. Yet, I welcome you to bring all your questions, doubts, and mis-readings to the class so we can all grow in our learning together.

**Land Acknowledgment:** As members of Columbia’s Morningside campus, we acknowledge that those of us located in Manhattan are on the territory of the Lenape and Wappinger peoples.  Indigenous people from many nations live and work in this region today.  Some of us are in other parts of the American subcontinent. Many indigenous communities have lived in and moved through this place over time. I ask you to research the indigenous histories of your land and share it with our class.  Our digital infrastructure is also grounded in the same theft of land and resources under colonialism. We acknowledge  and  pay respect to the native elders past and present, and recognize their active presence and their futurity, reposed in the generations present and those to come.

**Academic integrity** is a basic understanding of our engagement in this course. I make a commitment to engage ethically and honestly with you, and I expect the same commitment. Plagiarism or dishonesty and unethical behavior is unacceptable and you will face punitive measures. You should be well-aware and actively cognizant of Columbia University's commitment to Academic Integrity. You can read the policy here. In this class, you are required to submit your original work, properly cited, for each assignment. The use of BARD, chatGPT or any other AI front-end to a LLM is prohibited. Please turn your mobile phones off when you sit down in the class. If you have any concerns, problems, issues, please talk to me. I can help. 

**Accommodations:** If you believe you may encounter barriers to the academic environment due to a documented disability or emerging health challenges, please feel free to contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS). 

**Assessments:** We want to build a community of readers and thinkers in this class - who are able to work collectively and collaboratively. I am setting my assessment goals on two paths: firstly, I want to make sure we are doing close-reading of the texts, and secondly, I want to ensure that we are critical and engaged thinkers. With those goals, I ask that you do two forms of regular production in the class - short form writing and research oriented presentation.

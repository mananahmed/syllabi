##History of South Asia I: al-Hind to Hindustan  

Manan Ahmed, Department of History 

 
###Course Objectives

There are three broad objectives to the course: First, to gain a fuller comprehension of the political, social and cultural history of the sub-continent (termed al- Hind wa’l Sind by Sassanian and Arabian observers in the 5th & 6th centuries; and Hindustan from the 11th century onwards in most polities). Second, to delve into primary source materials (epigraphic, monumental, textual or visual) pertaining to crucial themes and sites from this history, in order to gain an appreciation of the transculturation processes through which varied communities organized themselves. Third, to familiarize oneself with dominant historiographical trends in the study of South Asia – particularly reflecting on ways in which early and medieval periods are categorized.  This is a history class, and our effort will be to act and acquaint ourselves as a historian - the focus will be to engage productively with primary sources, historiography, and produce analytical pieces of writings.

### Course Description
This course is the first of a two semester survey focusing on historical evolution of polities, cultures and societies in the Indian sub-continent from the early to the postcolonial period.

South Asia is defined in the academic realm as stretching from Afghanistan to Burma - a land mass roughly equivalent to 60% of the land mass of United States but with nearly five times the population, that is ethnically, linguistically and religiously heterogenous. Given this diversity, and the scope of civilizational presences reaching back to many thousands years BCE, it is futile to assert continuities. Rather, we can understand that across this geographic realm, continue through time, processes which are multi-layered, complex and within which history and memory remain in constant flux.  

We have a very limited, highly prejudiced, imagination when it comes to comprehending the premodern in South Asia. This is so because our evidences are often fragmentary, malleable or encoded in political and social tropes that are overtly determined. But the fault doesn’t lie there. It lies, I would argue, in our overtly presentist vocabulary within which we chose to frame the past. The words we use, informed by our immediate past, are already encoded with incomprehensible difference – coercion , submission , conversion , conflict . The categories we construct are already hegemonic – “Hindu,” “Muslim,” “invader,” “native.” We take these ahistoricized words and categories and proceed to give them universality that they don’t deserve even for the here and the now. What is produced are deeply pessimistic formulations, of clashes and conquests, which suggest only intractable fault lines etched into the sites and spaces of South Asia. 

Instead of focusing on entrenchments, our course will focus on processes and networks of transmissions  - imperial formations, transculturation, movement of goods and people, circulation of narratives - and the political and social worlds which are formed, contested and re-imagined through them. 

We will divide the course into six circles - often overlapping with chronologies within . Each circle constitutes a thematic core, a chronology, and a set of primary source materials. 

**I: Theories of Kingship: Chakravartin, Raja, Sultan, Shahanshah** 

This section will cover the political economy roughly from 300 BCE to 1550 CE. We begin with a survey of the physical and political geography of the sub-continent and continue with the various dynastic rulers in this broad landscape. Two key concerns will orient us: Regionalism and Kingship. The political polities we will cover include: Gupta, Chola, Gurjara Patihara, Rashtrakuta, Chalukya, Arab Sindh, Ghaznavid, Delhi Sultanate, Bahmani, Vijayanagara, Mughal & Portuguese India. The concepts of Chakravartin, rajaya, khalifa, sultan, shah would lead us to think about claims to political legitimacy and political theology.

**II: Sacral Geography: Mobilities, Nodes & Networks**

This section will cover the emergence of cities, the development of pilgrimage and trade routes, and the ways in which temples, markets and ports appear as markers of civitas and habitus. We will cover the Rome-Indic Trade, the Silk Route, the pilgrimage routes connecting Bengal and Kashmir, Multan and Madurai. We will look at the cities of Kanuaj, Delhi, Bijapur, Vijayanagar, Patna, and Tanjavur. We will also look at the Thar Desert and the Sundarban forest to cover questions of ecology and Nature.

**III: Political Theology: Governance, Religion, Ritual, Monumentalism**

This section will cover the ways in which various political entities made sense of their particular claim to governance across regnal, sacral, cultural and political landscapes. Our main concepts will be Monumenatalism, Divinity, Violence, Courtly Culture, Sacral Communities and their interaction with the Court.

**IV: Transculturation: Conversion, Translation** 

This section will look at ways in which the various communities (elite or subaltern) shaped their own selves and their others in a dialogue. We will read works of Sufi and Bhakti traditions and examine what "conversion" in medieval South Asia looked like.

**V: Literary Cultures: Script, Language, Canon**

The section will focus on the role of literary culture - the ways in which language, script, texts, and narratives shape the social, cultural and political self . We will look at Sanskrit and Persian Cosmopolis and also examine the Telegu case in detail.

**VI: Historical Memory: Historiography, Imagined Pasts** 

Our last section will look at the presence of this long past in contemporary and near-contemporary moments and examine how a  particular past is used to explain, uncritically, or to justify, unambiguously, that which is left unexamined and unassimilated in the present. We will read a novel, and examine in-depth specific moments of rupture in the present.

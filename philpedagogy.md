**Shape Your Syllabus**: My courses have a distinct argument framing my intellectual concern, question or argument. I am very explicit and detailed about the Assessments-- I believe in doing micro-assessments throughout the course and releasing the grades immediately. Transparency in grading and assessment is key to creating a sustainable and productive relationship. 

**Frame the frame**: I am eager to discuss historiography alongside history, including critically, my own scholarly tradition. Similarly, I began every class’s discussion by asking students to re-call and re-assess their previous encounter in the last class. What stuck with them, and why? It helps to be meta about the class to make clear power and learning. 

**Space**: I believe in spatial pedagogy. As much as possible, I move students around: by organizing in a circle, taking the class outside, small group work. I also use my body in different ways– sitting or standing in different corners. It keeps the classroom discussion fluid.

**Pick your paragraph**: I ask that, for every class, students pre-pick a particular passage (of their own concerns) and be prepared to share that passage with the class, and discuss how they interpret it, if and when called upon. This becomes a tool for creating a community of interpreters. It also ensures that students have a concrete footing in the class. 

**Theory Talk**: I respect and believe in the intelligence of my students. They can handle any critical and analytical language that I may wish to deploy. I often give names of theorists, or put up readings to follow up for students. I have never been disappointed by their engagement. Raising the bar of engagement is fruitful for me and for them.

**Writing**: I do small informal in-class writing the first day, once or twice in the middle, and at the end. “Take a piece of paper and write down how you would teach this class” was something I gave the first day of my history survey. These are un-graded, and I do not return them. But it helps me promote spontaenity, and also see the level of thinking and writing for each student. 

**Creative Assignments**: Pre-packaged assignments are boring for everyone involved. I use material culture, close reading, visual analysis, digital essays, walks, site-visits, newspaper hunts and video-essays. I do in-class group work very regularly to create lateral connections among the students. 

**Feedback**: I believe that mid-semester feedback (anonymous via Google Forms) is very very effective way to do a course-correction. I ask specific questions about class participation and assessment techniques. I give my own feedback either as written comments or (my preference) in a one-on-one meeting. I always aim to improve the strongest parts of the student's work and ask them to rely on university wide services (writing center etc.) should they face difficulties. I make sure I am clear that I highly respect and appreciate the work of pedagogy and encourage their usage of such resources.

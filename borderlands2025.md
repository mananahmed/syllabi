**Course Description**: Although questions of national expansion and boundary creation were fundamental to the work of such leading nineteenth-century historians as Francis Parkman and Frederick Jackson Turner, only in recent years have these topics recaptured the historical imagination.  Scholars operating under the rubric of “borderlands history” have found the complex racial composition, forbidding yet fragile environment, wars of conquest, boom and bust development, and rapid urbanization of border regions around the world to be fertile terrain for a wide range of fresh approaches to the past.  No longer marginal regions relegated the periphery of historical analysis, the borderlands have instead emerged in this new literature as central to any effort to grapple with notions of empire and imperialism, the contingent nature of state building and of race, gender, and sexuality, and with transnational and comparative units of historical analysis.  

This course will take a “Global Borderlands” approach to the question of colonial and imperial power of boundary marking, border making and “allowed/denied” mobilities. We will focus on connecting these global sites in the longue durèe as well in the contemporary world. 

**Expectations:**  The class is designed as a graduate-level discussion seminar, designed to explore the emerging field of borderlands history globally.  Over the semester, students will be expected to complete three assignments, two written and one oral.  

* Write responses to the weekly readings on EdDiscussions—posted the day before class prior to 10 PM.  These responses should cover the readings and aim to highlight theoretical and methodological themes that resonated with you.  Feel free to engage with your peers and their responses—especially where thematic overlaps emerge. 

* Write an essay where you do a spatial analysis of a bordered space over time. Details are in Assignments. This is due March 31st.

* Co-Lead, with a partner, a classroom discussion to a particular week’s set of readings.  Aim to present historical, historiographic and authorial context for the readings to the class before presenting your questions. The presentation and the discussion should take about 40 minutes of class time. Post your discussion questions to EdDiscussions a day before the class so your peers can come prepared for the class. 

* Write a review essay comparing two of the books that we read this semester (approximately 3,500 words). Further guidelines are under the Assignments tab. This essay is due on or before May 10th.

Grades: Marks will be determined according to in-class participation and written assignments.

**Academic Integrity:** Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated under any circumstances.  Should students have any question as to what constitutes appropriate academic behavior, they are encouraged to consult with the professor and to revisit the Faculty Statement on Academic Integrity:

"The intellectual venture in which we are all engaged requires of faculty and students alike the highest level of personal and academic integrity.  As members of an academic community, each one of us bears the responsibility to participate in scholarly discourse and research in a manner characterized by intellectual honesty and scholarly integrity."

In this class, you are required to submit your original work, properly cited, for each assignment. The usage of BARD, chatGPT or any other AI front-end to a LLM in order to generate ideas, begin or end writing assignments, clean up grammar or fill out paragraphs is prohibited.  If you need help with writing, you should visit the writing center or my office hours.

The classroom is also a space built on mutual trust. It is expected that all students will conduct themselves with a spirit of lively yet tolerant exchange, in which disagreements are welcomed yet treated with respect.  Since discussion is central to the seminar format, it is essential that all students come to class having completed the assigned reading.  Prompt, regular attendance is expected of all class participants.  Please turn off laptops and cell phones for the duration of the class. You do not have my permission to record audio or video in this class. If you need accommodation, you must go through the Accommodation office to request note-taking facility. Columbia also stipulates that such recordings are intended solely for students registered in the courses and not for public viewing. Students are also not permitted to allow anyone to view or listen to class sessions, recordings, or any course materials, and students will not copy, forward, or share said recordings/materials. Please turn your mobile phones off when you sit down in the class. If you have any concerns, problems, issues, please talk to me. 

The (Never Ending) Pandemic: This remains a strange time.  Please try to follow best practices for limiting the transmission of the virus and please keep the professor informed as to any health concerns. 

**Indigenous Acknowledgment:** At Columbia's Morningside campus, we acknowledge that we are on the territory of the Lenape and Wappinger peoples.  Many indigenous communities have lived in and moved through this place over time.  Indigenous people from many nations live and work in this region today.  We acknowledge their communities by paying respect to their elders past and present, and recognizing their active presence and their futurity, reposed in the generations present and those to come.

**Readings:**

All assigned books (with ISBNs listed) are available at Book Culture (536 West 112th Street) and on reserve at the Columbia library.  All assigned articles (and some books) have been uploaded to Courseworks. Others are available via Library/OA.

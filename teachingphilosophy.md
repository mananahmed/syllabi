## Shorthand Teaching Philosophy

**Shape the syllabus**: My courses have a distinct argument framing my intellectual concern, question or field of inquiry. Shaping the syllabus as an intellectual argument helps me give temporal coherence as well as guide me in choosing the right reading.

**Frame the frame**: I discuss historiography alongside history, including critically, my own scholarly tradition. Similarly, I begin every class’s discussion by asking students to re-call and re-assess the discussion from the last class. What stuck with them, and why? It helps to be meta about the instruction as well as the class to make improve the learning experience. 

**Space**: I insist on spatial pedagogy. As much as possible, I move myself around and I move the students around: by organizing in a circle, taking the class outside, small group work. I position myself in different parts of the room and use the re-articulation of power as means of keeping classroom discussion fluid. More expansively, I conceive of the space of classroom extending beyond the physical meeting-room and engage with students in online fora and through walks and off-site group meetings.

**Pick your paragraph**: I usually ask that, for every seminar class, students pre-pick a particular passage (of their own concerns) and be prepared to share that passage with the class, and discuss how they interpret it, if and when called upon. This becomes a tool for creating a community of interpreters. It also ensures that students have a concrete footing in the class. 

**Theory Talk**: I respect and believe in the intelligence of my students. That is, they can handle any critical and analytical language that I may wish to deploy. I often give names of historians, theorists, or put up readings to follow up for students. I have never been disappointed by their engagement. Raising the bar of engagement has always proven fruitful for me and for them.

**Writing**: I do small informal in-class writing the first day, once or twice in the middle, and at the end. “Take a piece of paper and write down how you would teach this class” was something I gave the first day of my history survey. These are un-graded, and I do not return them. But it helps me promote spontaenity, and also see the level of thinking and writing for each student. 

**Creative Assignments**: I use material culture, close reading, visual analysis, digital essays, walks, site-visits, newspaper hunts and video-essays. I do in-class group work very regularly to create lateral connections among the students. I am very explicit and detailed about the Assessments-- I believe in doing micro-assessments throughout the course and releasing the grades immediately. Transparency in grading and assessment is key to creating a sustainable and productive relationship. 

**Feedback**: I believe that mid-semester feedback (anonymous via Google Forms) is an effective way to do a course-correction. I ask specific questions about class participation and assessment techniques. I give my own feedback either as written comments or (my preference) in a one-on-one meeting. I always aim to improve the strongest parts of the student's work and ask them to rely on university wide services (writing center etc.) should they face difficulties.

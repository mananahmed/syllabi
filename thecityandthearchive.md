### Course Overview:
How to write the city? What is an archive for writing the city? What liminal and marginal perspectives are available for thinking about writing the city? What is the place of the city in the global south in our historical imagination? Our attempt in this seminar is to look at the global south city from the historical and analytical perspectives of those dispossessed and marginal. Instead of ‘grand’ summations about “the Islamic City” or “Global City,” we will work meticulously to observe annotations on power that constructs cities, archives and their afterlives. The emphasis is on the city in South Asia as a particular referent though we will learn to see Cairo, New York, and Istanbul. We will also ‘write’ the city, with particular attention to the archives of Sister Aisha al-Adawiya < https://crcc.usc.edu/aisha-al-adawiya-making-space-for-women-in-mosques/> available at Union Theological Seminary and of Muslim Sufi and Jazz musician Ibrahim González < https://current.org/2013/06/ibrahim-gonzalez-wbai-personality-and-producer-dies-at-57/> at Centro de Estudios Puertorriqueños (CUNY). These archives of individual lives and their relationship to New York City’s Black and Latinx populations will be the base from which we will attempt to parse out our individual relationship to writing New York.

#### Academic Integrity:
Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated under any circumstances.  Should students have any question as to what constitutes appropriate academic behavior, they are encouraged to consult with the professor and to revisit the Faculty Statement on Academic Integrity, available on-line at: https://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity-statement

Any breach of this intellectual responsibility is a breach of faith with the rest of our academic community. It undermines our shared intellectual culture, and it cannot be tolerated. Students failing to meet these responsibilities should anticipate being asked to leave Columbia.

#### Accommodations:
If you believe you may encounter barriers to the academic environment due to a documented disability or emerging health challenges, please feel free to contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS).

### Assessments:
We want to build a community of readers and thinkers in this class - who are able to work collectively and collaboratively. I am setting my assessment goals on two paths: firstly, I want to make sure we are doing close-reading of the texts, and secondly, I want to ensure that we are critical and engaged thinkers. With those goals, I ask that you do two forms of regular production in the class - short form writing and research-oriented presentation.

## Course Description

This course is intended to provide a broad yet thorough grounding in the major themes in historical writings on South Asia ca. 1947-2000. Historians of/and about South Asia have participated in defining major debates across academies, especially in postcolonial studies with? the prominence of Subaltern Studies in the 80s and 90s. In 1947, the twinned “Republic of India” and “Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” gained independence from British colonial rule. With independence came the establishment of new universities and history departments but also the continuation of centuries old tradition of studying the subcontinent at Oxford and Cambridge. After 1957’s launch of Sputnik, United States embarked on a massive investment in the study of the “Third World” to keep Communism at bay, giving rise to “Area Studies.” The longstanding disciplines of “Indology” and “Oriental studies” gave way to new anthropologies of “Village India” and eventually to the rise of “Development Studies.” Fulbright and Rhodes scholarships took students from Lahore and Delhi and Calcutta and Mysore to the US and the UK to study. From such grounds would the study of colonial rule and governance, and ideas of Kingship, caste, and Hinduism develop along both nationalist and Marxist lines.  A signal event in this history occurred in 1983, when the emergence of the Subaltern Studies collective marked the South Asian historical discipline’s first major intervention into the global academy. Since then, South Asian historiography has contributed importantly to postcolonial thought and to the study of Women, Gender and Sexuality. This course takes a theme centered approach to these histories, in order to highlight the major ideas, presuppositions, and arguments for the second half of twentieth century.

To be clear, this is not a course on the history of South Asia, nor are we going to focus on the task of history-writing itself (albeit parenthetically). We will also not cover major historians of the anti-colonial period (1890-1950). Rather, the attempt throughout the course is to introduce students to the ‘canonical,’ field-defining texts from the first fifty years of the post-colonial period. "South Asian Studies", as a field, is certainly far broader than History and we will generally *not* cover any of the foundational scholarship from Anthropology, Sociology, Political Science or Literature.

## Class Expectations

The class is designed as a graduate-level discussion seminar. Doing full and complete assigned readings, plus any further research to understand the historiography or theory, is necessary for full participation in the class. You are also expected to act respectfully and with an open disposition with your peers and colleagues. You should respect both the intellectual and social space of the seminar room.

* March 1: Annotated Bibliography of an Event (~15 entries): 20%
* May 1: Final Essay (5000 words): 40%
* CW weekly discussion posts (each ~300-500 words): 30%
* Class Participation: 10%

There are two types of writing assignments.

1. First, your weekly discussion posts which should be around 300-500 words. They should reflect thinking across all the assigned readings under the week's topic and aim to be substantively thematic and summary in nature.
2. 2.	The final essay covers the historiography of a singular event–built around a primary source or sources. Certain events have created enormous historiographies: 16 December 1971 (the creation of Bangladesh) or 6 December 1992 (destruction of Babri Masjid) are such two major events. You can either choose one of these events or propose another event* from from this period. The first step is to create an annotated bibliography (due March 1) on the event you choose, focusing on historical writing before or after the event, including at least 2 primary sources: these can can be legal, diplomatic, visual, media, oral histories, memoirs etc. The final essay will be your reading of the event, through a particular slice of historiography of the event, incorporating your own reading of primary sources.

## Colonization/Decolonization

![How United States soldiers were met by conquered natives](images/Col_DeCol_cover.jpg)[^1]


This course examines the processes of colonization and decolonization that define the making of a modern, integrated world (c. 1500 to the present). We will study primary source materials.  We focus on the instruments of colonization—the treaty, the charter, the map, the ethnology—and the engines of decolonization—the manifesto, the resistance, the solidarity with the colonial, the demand for self rule. We are interested in the processes and contents of social and cultural contact and exchange, the development of knowledge, and how they shape relations of power; the place of colonialism in the development of western capitalism; and the elements of colonial power and resistance, including ideologies of liberal political philosophy, social Darwinism, and nationalism.  

We will consider how ideas about race, civilization, religion, self and other, and freedom have evolved over time and shaped the making of the modern world. We will also incorporate, as much as possible, the history of New York City and of Columbia in our readings.  Those who want to know more about Columbia’s history are encouraged to visit the website of the Columbia University [Historical Justice Initiative](https://www.cuhistorytour.com). Class is held as a discussion seminar based on close reading of primary-source documents, literature, film, and music.

**Land Acknowledgment:** As members of Columbia’s Morningside campus, we acknowledge that we are on the territory of the Lenape and Wappinger peoples.  Many indigenous communities have lived in and moved through this place over time.  Indigenous people from many nations live and work in this region today.  We acknowledge their communities by paying respect to their elders past and present, and recognizing their active presence and their futurity, reposed in the generations present and those to come.

**Academic Integrity:** Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated under any circumstances.  Should students have any question as to what constitutes appropriate academic behavior, they are encouraged to consult with the professor and to revisit the Faculty Statement on Academic Integrity, available [on-line](https://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity-statement) Any breach of this intellectual responsibility is a breach of faith with the rest of our academic community. It undermines our shared intellectual culture, and it cannot be tolerated. Students failing to meet these responsibilities should anticipate being asked to leave Columbia.

**Assessments:** We want to build a community of readers and thinkers in this class - who are able to work collectively and collaboratively. I am setting my assessment goals on two paths: firstly, I want to make sure we are doing close-reading of the texts, and secondly, I want to ensure that we are critical and engaged writers. With those goals, I ask that you do two forms of regular production in the class - short form writing and research oriented presentation.

* 20 points for Participation: To get the full points, you will attend every single class, and be an active listener to your colleagues, and sometimes, a commenter and facilitator for their ideas and sometimes, a speaker of your own thoughts.
* 10 points for Digital Archive Report on either of the three: 1) [Museum of Chinese in America NYC](https://www.mocanyc.org/) or [South Asian American Digital Archive](https://www.saada.org/) or [NYPL Schomburg Digital Collections](https://www.nypl.org/about/locations/schomburg/digital-schomburg/online-exhibitions)
* 25 points for Presentations on Context/Time: Every class, one student will deliver a short-presentation on the context for the [starred] Text/Author we are reading. This context will comprise of 10 headlines (only) selected from newspapers contemporary to the Text/Author. You can use the Historical Newspaper databases on Clio. This presentation will be posted on Piazza before the class begins. Expect to invest around 15 hours of research, writing and prepration for this presentation. The presentation cannot last more than 15 minutes.
* 15 points for Discussion on CW: For your comment/discussions on the CW posts of your colleagues after the class.
* 30 points for putting together and participating on a Conference on Decolonization 2020.
